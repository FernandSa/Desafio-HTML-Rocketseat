                <p>I’m dishonest, and a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly. 
                    It’s the honest ones you want to watch out for, because you can never predict when 
                    they’re going to do something incredibly … stupid.

                Jack Sparrow was a legendary pirate of the Seven Seas, and the irreverent trickster of the Caribbean. 
                A captain of equally dubious morality and sobriety, a master of self-promotion and self-interest, 
                Jack fought a constant and losing battle with his own best tendencies. Jack's first love was the sea, 
                his second, his beloved ship the Black Pearl.
